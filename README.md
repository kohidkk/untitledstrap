## FAQ

Q: Is there viruses?

A: Of course not it's a complete open source project

Q: Is this only a fork of Bloxstrap with new features?

A: Yes, for now I(Eterny) plan on recoding the whole source

## Features

- The best of Bloxstrap
- More optimization

## Installing
(add releases here)

You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Bloxstrap after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, Untitledstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.

## Code

Untitledstrap uses the [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) library for the user interface design. We currently use Bloxstrap's fork of WPF UI at [bloxstraplabs/wpfui](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/wpfui).
